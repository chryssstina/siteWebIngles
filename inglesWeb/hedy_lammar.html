                                      at IFCE Campus Iguatu - Cajazeiras Unit. The team is made up of Maria Chrystina, Francisco Vinicius,
                                      José Carlos and Maria Eduarda, where together we made this site as a way of relating the Instrumental
                                      English subject, taught by Prof. Vilmar, and presenting great names who were and still are part of
                                      computing. In this way, we aim to blend these two worlds and share knowledge with more people who 
                                      are interested in learning more about both.

    <section class="biografia">

          <div> Hedy Lamarr is actually the stage name of actress and scientist Hedwig Eva Marie Kiesler, who was responsible for several inventions and discoveries that revolutionized communications technology. 
 
 Hedy Lamarr was a scientist and during the Second World War she invented, in partnership with George Anthiel, a radio interference device to throw off Nazi radars, which would later serve as the basis for the creation of Wi-Fi, because Hady, when performing a duet with George, playing the piano, realized that if the transmitter and receiver constantly changed frequency, the two could communicate without fear of being intercepted. However, his invention was rejected by the National Inventors Council on the grounds of sexism, which led to the failure of American torpedoes due to their inaccuracy.
 
 Her invention was only officially used in 1962 during the Missile Crisis and only became known in 1997 when the Electronic Frontier Foundation awarded her a prize for her contribution to science.</div>
